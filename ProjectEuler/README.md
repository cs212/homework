Project Euler
=================================================

For this homework assignment, you will create a solution for [Project Euler Problem #6](http://projecteuler.net/problem=6). This problem states:

> The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + &middot;&middot;&middot; + 10<sup>2</sup> = 385
>
> The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 + 2 + &middot;&middot;&middot; + 10)<sup>2</sup> = 552 = 3025
>
> Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 &ndash; 385 = 2640. Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

## Files ##

The following files are required for this project.

- [`src/ProjectEuler06.java`](src/ProjectEuler06.java)
- [`src/ProjectEuler06Test.java`](src/ProjectEuler06Test.java)

Please download the above files and add them to your Java project in Eclipse to get started. See the [Homework README](../README.md) for details on how to download individual files or subdirectories from this repository.

## Hints ##

Below are some hints that may help with this homework assignment:

- You can square a number by multiplying it by itself. For example, `i * i` will give you the square of `i`.

- Each method involves a traditional `for` loop. The difference is when you sum versus multiply.

You are not required to use these hints in your solution. There may be multiple approaches to solving this homework.
