Book Sorter
=================================================

For this homework, you will (a) create several [`Comparator`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html) objects (as anonymous inner classes) that allow for custom sorting of books, and (b) create several unit tests to verify book attributes are being set correctly. The [`Book`](src/Book.java) class is provided for you.

## Files ##

You must modify code in the following files:

- [`src/Books.java`](src/Books.java) (add custom comparators)
- [`src/BookTest.java`](src/BookTest.java) (add custom unit tests)

The remaining files are also required for this project, but do not require modification:

- [`src/Book.java`](src/ArgumentParser.java)
- [`src/BookSorterTest.java`](src/BookSorterTest.java)

Please download the above files and add them to your Java project in Eclipse to get started.

## Requirements ##

The official name of this homework is `BookSorter`. This should be the name you use for your Eclipse Java project, the subdirectory used in your private GitHub homework repository, and the name you use when running the `homework` test script.

You must pass all unit tests when running the `/home/public/cs212/homework` script on the lab computers to receive a 100% on this homework assignment.
