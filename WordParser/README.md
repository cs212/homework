Word Parser
=================================================

For this homework assignment, you will create a class that parses words from `String` objects. Assume words are separated by whitespaces, and convert text to a consistent format by converting it to lowercase and replacing special characters with an empty string. See the Javadoc comments in the [`WordParser.java`](src/WordParser.java) template code for additional details.
