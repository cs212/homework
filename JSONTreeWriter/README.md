JSON Tree Writer
=================================================

For this homework assignment, you will create a class that outputs various tree structures as JSON objects or arrays to file. See the Javadoc comments in the [`JSONTreeWriter.java`](src/JSONTreeWriter.java) template code for additional details.

## Files ##

The following files are required for this project.

- [`src/JSONTreeWriter.java`](src/JSONTreeWriter.java)
- [`src/JSONTreeWriterTest.java`](src/JSONTreeWriterTest.java)

Please download the above files and add them to your Java project in Eclipse to get started. 

## Requirements ##

The official name of this homework is `JSONTreeWriter`. This should be the name you use for your Eclipse Java project, the subdirectory used in your private GitHub homework repository, and the name you use when running the homework test script.

You must pass all unit tests when running the `/home/public/cs212/homework` script on the lab computers to receive a 100% on this homework assignment.

:warning: Do not embed test cases in the `JSONTreeWriter` class! Your solution must generalize.

## Hints ##

Below are some hints that may help with this homework assignment:

- Eclipse has built-in file comparison functionality. It can show you exactly how your file output differs from the expected output (even if its just a trailing space at the end of a line).

- The [official JSON documentation](http://www.json.org/) can be a little difficult to parse. There [are](http://www.w3schools.com/json/) [many](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JSON/article.html) [other](https://www.json.com/) tutorials out there.

You are not required to use these hints in your solution. There may be multiple approaches to solving this homework.
