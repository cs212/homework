HTML Cleaner
=================================================

Motivation
-------------------------------------------------

Eventually, we want to be able to crawl the web and parse web pages. As such, we must be able to remove all of the HTML code from a web page and parse it into words. This assignment is a step towards this functionality.

Background
-------------------------------------------------

We do not explicitly cover HTML in this class. However, this markup language should be easy to pickup for any programmer. Some resources include:

* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [W3C Markup Validation](http://validator.w3.org/)
* [Web Design Group](http://htmlhelp.com/)
* [W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/)
